# Binary-Search-Trees
 This program utilizes Binary Search Trees (BST) ,  file  IO , relevant  traversal
 
Project 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in this Program I have read a text file (in.txt) that contains a set of words. The first line 
of the file contains 3 numbers (N, S, D). These numbers represent the sequence of input words in 
the file. 

N:    represents  the  number  of  words  to  read  to  build  binary  search  tree.  You  have  to  write  a 
recursive insert code to create and insert these  words into the binary search tree. After inserting 
all the items, you should show the words in Pre order, In order, and Post order. So, you need to 
create three functions for this purpose. 

S: represents the number of the words to search from the tree. These S words are placed after the 
first N words in the input file.You need to implement a search function that will be able to search 
these words in your BST.  

D: represents the number of words to be deleted from the BST. This list of words are placed after 
N+S words in the input file. Write a recursive delete function for your task. After deleting all the 
items, also show the tree in only in-order traversal. 

Along with the code is the in.txt file which the code reads, and the out.txt file which writes the output.
